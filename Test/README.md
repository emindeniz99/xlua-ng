# Test coverage

The repository has a bridge unit suite, performance examples, native regression
checks, and Unity player checks. It does not yet have an exhaustive test matrix
for every supported Unity version, platform, backend, or optional extension.

## General C# bridge suite

`Test/UnitTest` exercises Lua-to-C# calls, the explicit reflection cases, and
C#-to-Lua calls. The Lua runner (`StreamingAssets/main.lua`) enables three
suites containing 277 tests and runs them twice: first inside a coroutine,
then on the main thread. Its generated-code and TDR-specific suites are
currently commented out upstream; a pass does not mean those optional suites
ran.

The tests run on [luaunit](https://github.com/bluebird75/luaunit) 3.5
(`StreamingAssets/luaunit.lua`, unmodified upstream file).
`StreamingAssets/luaunit_compat.lua` keeps the API the test files were written
for (`TestCase` classes, `SetUp`/`TearDown` hooks, `ASSERT_EQ`, `ASSERT_TRUE`)
and maps it onto luaunit: `ASSERT_EQ` is `assertEquals`, `ASSERT_TRUE` is
`assertEvalToTrue`. A failed assertion fails its test even when the test code
catches the error with `pcall`. Each mode prints a line such as
`[luaunit coroutine] Ran 277 tests in 0.2 seconds, 277 successes, 0 failures`,
and a failure in either mode raises a Lua error, which `LuaEnv.DoString`
turns into a C# exception.

With Mono 6.14.1 and `mcs` installed (`brew install mono` on macOS and Linux),
first build a host-native plugin, then run:

```sh
python3 Test/Native/run_managed.py --plugin /absolute/path/libxlua.so --output /absolute/path/test-output
```

The runner stops unless `mono --version` reports 6.14.1; pass `--mono-version any`
to skip that check. On macOS use a rebuilt `libxlua.dylib`. `--mono` and `--compiler` accept explicit
tool paths; an `.exe` compiler runs through Mono. The runner compiles the
existing project source lists, copies test data to the output directory, saves
`managed-suite.log`, and fails unless the process exits with 0 and both
modes report 277 tests run and 277 successes.
With `--gen-code` it then builds the tools, runs `XLuaGenerate` on the test
assembly, compiles `XLuaUnitTestGenCode` from the freshly generated wrappers
(not the checked-in `General/Gen2` snapshot) and runs the same 277 tests again
through generated code (`managed-suite-gencode.log`). `--gen-code-minimize` adds
a third run with `GEN_CODE_MINIMIZE` (`managed-suite-gencode-minimize.log`), which
uses the smaller generated code and the native C# function wrapper helpers. CI,
`sanitize.sh` and `coverage.sh` use all three modes.

`Test/Native/signature_check.py --output <empty dir>` builds the signing tools,
creates a key, signs a script, and checks that `SignatureLoader` accepts it
and rejects tampered, truncated and legacy SHA-1 files.

`Test/Native/luacats_check.py --plugin <libxlua> --output <dir>` builds
`XLuaGenerate.exe`, writes LuaCATS definitions for `Test/LuaCATS/Sample.cs` and
compares them with `Test/LuaCATS/expected` (`--update` rewrites them). It also
generates definitions for `XLuaUnitTest.exe`. With `--download-luals` (Linux,
lua-language-server 3.19.1, checked by SHA-256) or `--luals <executable>`, it
runs lua-language-server over `Test/LuaCATS/good.lua`, which must have no
diagnostics, and `bad.lua`, whose diagnostics must match its `-- expect:`
comments. Use a plugin built with Lua 5.3 or later; the expected files use
`integer`.

`Test/Native/hotfix_check.py --plugin <libxlua> --output <dir>` checks hotfix
injection end to end. It builds the tools, compiles `Test/Native/HotfixFixture.cs`
with the xLua sources and the hotfix bridges that `XLuaGenerate` writes, injects
it with `XLuaHotfixInject` and runs it under `mono --debug`. The fixture covers
instance and static methods, a constructor, a property, `ref`/`out` parameters,
a struct, a generic class, `base(self)`, a type selected by a `[Hotfix]` list
and an `IntKey` type. It checks the original results, the results after
`xlua.hotfix`, and the original results again after `xlua.hotfix(..., nil)`.
This runs for an assembly with a portable `.pdb`, with the `.mdb` that
`mcs -debug` writes, without symbols, and with an unreadable `.pdb`; line
numbers must survive injection, and a second injection must print
`had injected!` and leave the file unchanged. `Tools/build_tools.py` downloads
Mono.Cecil from nuget.org once into the gitignored `Tools/.cache`; set
`XLUA_TOOLS_CACHE` to use another directory (for a read-only checkout).

For the original Unity unit scene, copy `Test/UnitTest/xLuaTest` and
`Test/UnitTest/StreamingAssets` into a Unity project's `Assets` folder and run
`xLuaTest/main.unity`. This is a manual path, not the current CI entry point;
the Android test code still uses a legacy `/sdcard/luatest/` result path.
The runner writes the test names and the failed tests of each mode to
`luaunit_case_list[_co].txt` and `luaunit_case_failed[_co].txt` under
`LuaTestCommon.resultPath`.

## String and Unicode fixtures

The bridge suites already cover ASCII strings (for example `boo123`, `abc`,
and struct string fields), empty and long strings, escape sequences, and
multiline text. They also retain simplified and traditional Chinese strings,
stylized Chinese characters, and mixed punctuation/symbol fixtures. These are
functional encoding and marshaling data, not maintained language translations.

Keep those fixtures and their expected values intact. Add cases for new encoding
behavior or a regression, rather than duplicating an existing case merely to
change its language. The documentation language policy does not restrict the
character sets exercised by the tests.

## Native checks

```sh
python3 Test/Native/check_exports.py /absolute/path/libxlua.so
python3 Test/Native/profiler_smoke.py /absolute/path/libxlua.so
python3 Test/Native/native_regression.py /absolute/path/libxlua.so
```

These check the managed import symbols, GC bridge opcodes, memory profiler
graph traversal, and regressions for native defects found by the analysis
below. Run them against a library built for the host architecture.

OpenHarmony has no host-architecture library, so `Test/Native/ohos_check.sh
<OpenHarmony native SDK> <output dir>` builds libxlua for each OpenHarmony ABI
and runs `Test/Native/plugin_smoke.c` (Lua core, `uint64`, struct packing,
`os.tmpname`, `io.popen`, file seeks) on Linux. The SDK's dynamic loader only
works on an OpenHarmony system, so the smoke test is linked statically from the
object files CMake compiled for `libxlua.so`. ABIs the host cannot execute run
through qemu-user. armeabi-v7a does not run under qemu-arm (a static
OpenHarmony hello world already stops with SIGILL), so CI runs x86_64 and
arm64-v8a only. Loading the `.so` itself needs a device or the emulator.

## Static analysis, coverage and fuzzing

These cover xLua's own C files (`build/xlua.c`, `build/i64lib.c`,
`build/memory_leak_checker.c`); the vendored Lua, LuaJIT and LuaSocket code
is not analyzed. Each script takes an empty output directory and runs on Linux
with Clang. `Test/Native/analyze.sh` runs clang-tidy (`build/.clang-tidy`) and
`clang --analyze` for Lua 5.3.6, 5.4.9, 5.5.1 and LuaJIT, and fails on any
finding; suppress an intentional pattern with `NOLINT(check): reason` on the
line. `Test/Native/coverage.sh` builds with `-DXLUA_COVERAGE=ON`, runs the native
checks and the managed suite, and prints llvm-cov line and function coverage
per Lua version (it needs Mono like `run_managed.py`). With all three managed
modes, `xlua.c` reaches about 83% of lines and 78% of functions (2026-10-16).
The rest is struct cloning (`xlua.structclone`, `xlua_newstruct`,
`xlua_tostruct`), debug print helpers, the profiler return hook, and rare
error paths. `Test/Fuzz/run.sh
<seconds>` builds four libFuzzer targets with ASan and UBSan: Lua chunks loaded
through `xluaL_loadbuffer` in a sandbox env, the `uint64` library, struct
pack/unpack and accessors, and dotted-path table access. `FUZZ_OUT` and
`LUA_VERSION` select the output directory and runtime. A crash leaves a
reproducer in `$FUZZ_OUT/<target>/`.

`Test/Native/check_webgl_exports.py` does the import check for the Unity WebGL
plugin. It reads `llvm-nm --defined-only` output for the object file that
Emscripten builds from `Assets/Plugins/WebGL/xlua_webgl.cpp`; see the WebGL
section of `build/README.md`.

## Unity players and upstream examples

- [Mobile smoke checks](MobileSmoke/README.md): runtime initialization, GC,
  coroutines, close semantics and disposal in Unity/IL2CPP.
- [Upstream Android examples](Examples/README.md): original C#↔Lua tutorial
  scenes, Unity update callbacks and UI events with generated IL2CPP bridges.
- [Artifact CI](../.github/CI.md): manual native builds and test artifacts with
  no release creation. The real-editor matrix covers Unity 2021.3 LTS, 2022.3
  LTS, 6.0 LTS, 6.3 LTS, and the current 6.6 line when license secrets are
  configured. Unity device examples are run locally, outside CI.

## Performance tests

`Test/PrefTest` contains the upstream benchmark scene. Copy its directories into
`Assets` and run `xLuaPerfTest/Main.unity`. It is a benchmark, not a correctness
gate, and has not been rerun as part of the runtime upgrade validation.

Keep build/backend settings comparable when benchmarking. `HOTFIX_ENABLE` and
`THREAD_SAFE` can add bridge locking overhead. Unity API work and overloaded
method resolution also affect timings; a bridge benchmark should keep the
called method's own work small. Vector3 performance includes the actual C#
Unity struct calls rather than an equivalent implementation entirely in Lua.
